         The goal of path-sensitive analysis is to achieve accuracy by
accounting precisely for the execution behavior along each path
of a control flow graph (CFG). A practical adoption of PSA is
hampered by two roadblocks: (a) the exponential growth of the
number of CFG paths, and (b) the exponential complexity of a
path feasibility check. We introduce projected control graph
(PCG) as an optimal mathematical abstraction to address these
roadblocks.

The PCG follows from the simple observation that for any given
analysis problem, the number of distinct relevant execution behaviors
may be much smaller than the number of CFG paths. The PCG is
a projection of the CFG to retain only the relevant execution
behaviors and elide duplicate paths with identical execution
behavior. A mathematical definition of PCG and an efficient algorithm
to transform CFG to PCG are implemented in this utility.
